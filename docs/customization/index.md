## Go believers

You can define both the formatting and layout using Go code. With dedicated functions:

- `printer.WithPrettyFormatting` to override only the format
- `printer.WithPrettyLayout` to override only the layout
- `printer.WithPrettyRenderer` to provide your own render function

you can achieve what you need without leaving you favourite language.

    See the [mszostok/version#13](https://github.com/mszostok/version/issues/13) issue for a reference. If you want to see it, please add üëç under the issue.

So YAMLs, then? Yes! However, we are not so strict, you can also provide a JSON if you want.

You can configure that in different ways:

1. Enable loading style from environment variable via `version.WithPrettyStyleFromEnv("ENV_NAME_FOR_FILE_PATH")`,
2. Load a style file directly using Go function, `version.WithPrettyStyleFile`.
